# BatteryLoggingTool ("BLT")
BLT is a tool for logging the state and quality of batteries to estimate how they will perform
in competitions.

This tool is still in development, but when it's done, it'll be SO COOL and will cement team 3181's
reputation as one of the great developers of our age. Many years from now, when young children
ask their grandparents what it was like to live in the age of 3181, they will say, "SO COOL".

That is all.
